# This is my blog for my experiments of circle trails in p5.js
## This is my first experiment, which shows circles on a screen which gradually change colour from one corner to another (black in the top left, white in the bottom right, pink in the top right and green in the bottom left.)

Here we can see as follows:
White to black gradient.
![This is a trail from the top left corner to the bottom right, producing a white to black gradient]()
Pink to green gradient.
![This is a trail from the bottom left corner to the top right, producing a green to pink gradient]()
Both together.
